# Profile

Provides the profile entity type used to collect customer information. In Commerce 1.x, we called these entities "Customer Profiles" and for Commerce 2.x we have moved to where the community has extended user profiles to include fieldable entity bundles. Customer profiles in Commerce 2.x will be entities and orders will link to revisions, avoiding the duplication we had in Commerce 1.x.

The Profile module provides a fieldable entity, that allows administrators to define different sets of fields for user profiles, which are then displayed in the My Account section. This permits users of a site to share more information about themselves, and can help community-based sites organize users around specific information.

You can pull the latest from the repository on [fago's account at github.com](https://github.com/fago/profile2) or watch us as the community pushes hard to get the [whole thing committed to Drupal core](https://www.drupal.org/node/1726822) (we're very hopeful for a 8.1.0 release).
