Developer guide
===============

Development on Drupal Commerce is a community effort, and all are invited to join in where possible.  We're bringing together people from around the world with a wide range of expertise to make this a giant leap forward in Drupal based e-commerce.

In order to dive in, you should know where the code currently stands and how to contribute to it.  To that end, we'll be adding a project roadmap in the near future that ties into both a specification and issues in our <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/commerce">issue tracker</a> to visualize what we have completed and what remains to be done.

When you're ready to dive in, you should review the <a href="https://docs.drupalcommerce.org/commerce1/developer-guide/development-standards">development standards</a> and make sure you understand the Drupal Commerce <a href="https://docs.drupalcommerce.org/commerce1/developer-guide/code-workflow">code workflow</a>. Then go pick an issue, find other people working on the same system, and get to work!
