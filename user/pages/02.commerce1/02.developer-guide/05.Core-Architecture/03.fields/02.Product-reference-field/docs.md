-------

The product display field (aka 'Add to Cart field') is a fieldAPI field which is used to display a product/products to the end-user, typically as an Add-to-cart form which is displayed on a node.

Typically this field will be used on a node type. For example, a site may have a product node type which includes images, description, and a product display field. The end user will view this node and be able to add a product to the cart.
