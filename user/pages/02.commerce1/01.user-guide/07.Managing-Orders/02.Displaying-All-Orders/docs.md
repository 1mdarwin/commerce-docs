Views is the easy way to display all orders, including orders that are cart orders, etc. You can just edit the existing administrative view of orders and expose the filter, etc.

There is even a default view to change your Admin Orders view into a Views Bulk Operations view with all this functionality in [Commerce VBO Views](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_vbo_views)
