<p>Commerce Kickstart 2 comes with an administration toolbar tailored for specific needs. It gives you quick access to the most important tasks in order to have full control over your online shop.</p>
<p>However, if you prefer to use Drupal core's Toolbar module or the very popular <a title="Administration Menu module" href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu">Administration Menu</a>, you have the option to use them instead of the built-in toolbar. All you have to do is <strong>disable and uninstall Commerce Kickstart Menus module</strong> and you are ready to go with your choice.</p>
