<p>The Demo Store is an option in the installation process. This is a great way to get an idea of what is possible with Drupal Commerce and a few contributed modules. The demo store makes quite a few assumptions. For one, it assumes you are selling physical products. Thus, it has the shipping module all setup and ready to be used. Many of the store features are worth emulating or using as a basis for other sites. The following articles attempt to outline how to setup various features that can be found in the Commerce Kickstart 2 distribution.</p>
