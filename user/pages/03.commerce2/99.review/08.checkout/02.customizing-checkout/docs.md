You can alter the default checkout flow from here ``/admin/commerce/config/checkout-flows/manage/default``.

We can do basic some customization like, moving a pane into different step.

For example, we want to move *Billing information* in *Review* step.

![Move pane to different step](../images/checkout_customize_4.png)

Click **Save**.

Customers will be now asked for *Billing information* in *Review* step.
